# Advent of Code

This is a single project which contains all my solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), all solutions are written in PHP by myself. Snippets of problem text and input files are stored in the `storage` directory and in issues, these remain the property of AOC and are only stored here for my own reference. Please visit the home page of AOC to download your own problem datasets.
