# Advent of Code

This is a single project which contains all my solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), all solutions are written in PHP by myself. Snippets of problem text and input files are stored in the `storage` directory and in issues, these remain the property of AOC and are only stored here for my own reference. Please visit the home page of AOC to download your own problem datasets.

Here is a list of the challenges I have completed:

## Getting Started

These instructions will give you a copy of the project up and running on
your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

This project is built on top of [Laravel Zero](https://github.com/laravel-zero/laravel-zero), and needs php 8.2 or higher and the composer package manager installed on your system to run.

You will also need to provide puzzle input files in the `storage` directory, in this repo these are encrypted with `git-crypt` and are not included in the public repository. To read more about why puzzle input and challenge questions are private see [the AOC about page](https://adventofcode.com/about).

>If you're posting a code repository somewhere, please don't include parts of Advent of Code like the puzzle text or your inputs.

### Installing

After cloning the repository you can install all dependencies through composer by running:

Say what the step will be

    composer install

You can then run the main menu by running:

    php adventofcode browse
