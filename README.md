# Advent of Code

This is a single project which contains all my solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), all solutions are written in PHP by myself. You will also need to provide puzzle input files in the `storage` directory, in this repo these are encrypted with `git-crypt` and are not included in the public repository. To read more about why puzzle input and challenge questions are private see [the AOC about page](https://adventofcode.com/about). Please visit the home page of AOC to download your own problem datasets.
>If you're posting a code repository somewhere, please don't include parts of Advent of Code like the puzzle text or your inputs.
