# Advent of Code

This is a single project which contains all my solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). Here is a list of the challenges I have completed:

## 2015

- [Day 1: Not Quite Lisp](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/1) - `php adventofcode browse/2015/one
  `
- [Day 2: I Was Told There Would Be No Math](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/2) - `php adventofcode browse/2015/two`

- [Day 3: Perfectly Spherical Houses in a Vacuum](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/3) - `php adventofcode browse/2015/three
  `

## Getting Started

These instructions will give you a copy of the project up and running on
your local machine for development and testing purposes.
